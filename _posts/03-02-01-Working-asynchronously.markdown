> "An **asynchronos** working style is one where the entire team rarely, if ever, gets together for big agreements and 
discussions, each individual team member more or less works on their own and at their own pace, with collaboration and 
agreement being handled by asynchronous mechanisms such as e-mail and shared online documents. 
__Working asynchronously certainly enables the team to be geographically distributed, or telecommute, or maintain 
flexible hours.__"

> This is — by far — my favorite aspect of working at GitHub. Everything is asynchronous.
..Asynchronous communication means I can take a step out for lunch and catch up on transcripts when I get back. 
Asynchronous communication means I can ask my coworker a question in-chat and not worry about bothering her since 
she'll get back to me when she's available. Asynchronous communication means I can go to rural Minnesota and feel 
like I'm working from the office like normal.

> Hours are great ways to determine productivity in many industries, but not ours. Working in a startup is a much 
different experience than working in a factory. You can't throw more time at a problem and expect it to get solved. 
__Code is a creative endeavor.__ You need to be in the __right mindset__ to create high-quality code.

###Make email work

>
* __Be clear and precise.__ It's very easy to misinterpret email, especially across cultures and languages. 
    Re-read your emails before sending.
* __Document everything.__ Document all decisions - if it's not recorded in email, it didn't happen.
* __Share everything.__ Use email to share face-to-face hallway, office, lunchtime or post-meeting conversations.
* __Be inclusive.__ Leave time for other sites to read and reply before closing the issue (as appropriate).
* __Set up inclusive DLs.__ Having all stakeholders on the appropriate distribution lists is the easiest way to keep 
    from forgetting other sites. Don't hide DL membership.
* __Answer all questions asked.__ Incomplete answers lead to frustration and wasted time.
* __Avoid unnecessary questions.__ Ask yourself ‘is it really worth a 24-hour turn-around to answer this question? 
    Can I answer it myself, or ask someone local? Don't block an important thread with a trivial question.

###Make meetings effective

> Do you really need a meeting? Meetings usually arise when a concept __isn't clear enough.__ Instead of resorting to
 a meeting, try to simplify the concept so you can discuss it quickly via email or im or Campfire. __The goal is to 
 avoid meetings.__ 
Every minute you avoid spending in a meeting is a minute you can get real work done instead.

>
* __Pick the right forum.__ Use meetings rather than long email threads to discuss complex issues. 
    For small meetings, it is often better if everyone is in their own office rather than using a meeting room.
    this promotes equality between local and remote team members.
* __Share the context and goals.__ Shared context is critical to clear communication. There are often a lot of 
assumptions 
    you know in a particular location based on side-conversations, etc.
* __Share a deck.__ It's much easier to follow the conversation if everyone is looking at the same thing. 
    Even if you are sharing via OC or Live Meeting, send the deck or a link to the deck by email well in advance 
    (home connections can be slow) and call out each slide.
* __Send minutes promptly.__ After every meeting, send minutes documenting all decisions and including clear actions 
and owners. Avoid cryptic or overly-concise notes,imagine them being read or reported out by someone who wasn't 
there, six months later.
* __Record and share brown bags.__ Brown bags are often at unsociable hours. Recording and sharing helps partner 
teams as well as your own.

>
* __Speak clearly and slowly.__ The connections aren't always clear.
* __Be precise and concise.__ Help to keep the meeting short and productive.
* __Speak one at a time__, otherwise no-one can be heard.
* __Ask for confirmation__ that the callers heard everything clearly.
* __Sit near the microphone__, especially if your voice is soft.
* __Ask for comments.__ It's hard to break into the conversation over the phone.
* __Avoid jargon and culture-specific phrases.__ English is not the first language of many people on our teams, 
    and can also vary greatly across cultures.
* __Meet face to face from time to time.__  Meeting in person builds your knowledge of each other's mannerisms and 
communication style. Subsequent remote communications are much richer and misunderstandings rarer as a result.
